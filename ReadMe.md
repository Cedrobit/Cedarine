### Introduction
Cedarine. An extensive, cozy, somewhat nostalgic yet desaturated "forest-y" sort of color palette that is designed to make the lives of programmers easier by using desaturated colors inspired by forests for long hours with working on a display. Cedarine is also somewhat retro in a sense, with desaturated and yellowed colors.
